### Properties
_Pass an array of user objects as the value to a 'data' property (see example)._

|                |             |             |
| -------------: | :---------: | ----------- |
| **username**<br/>required | _String_ | Username that will be used by the employee to log on to TSheets. |

For a full list of properties that may be set on a user, see [the User object](#the-user-object).

### Status Codes
Each user that is created will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the user was created successfully. If there was a problem creating a user, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

| <code class="level400">417</code> | Expectation Failed. Something was wrong or missing with the properties supplied for this user. See the `_status_extra` value for more detail. |
