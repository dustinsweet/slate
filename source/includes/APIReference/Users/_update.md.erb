## Update Users

<%= partial "includes/APIReference/Users/Examples/update.tmpl.erb" %>

Edit one or more users in your company.  The batch of user updates is passed as a JSON string in the body of the HTTP request.  If the value passed in is the same as it was previously, or if a particular property is not passed in at all, it will be ignored.

### HTTP Request

<img src="images/put.png" alt="put"/><api>https://rest.tsheets.com/api/v1/users</api>


### Properties
_Pass an array of user objects as the value to a 'data' property (see example)._

|                |             |             |
| -------------: | :---------: | ----------- |
| **id**<br/>required | _Int_ | Id of the user to update. |

**OR**

|                |             |             |
| -------------: | :---------: | ----------- |
| **username**<br/>required | _String_ | Username of the user to update. |

All other properties defined on a [user object](#the-user-object) may be passed in to the request with a new value in order to change it. If the value passed in is the same as it was previously, or if a particular property is not passed in at all, it will be ignored.

### Status Codes
Each user that is edited will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the user was edited successfully. If there was a problem editing a user, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

|         |          |
| :-----: | :------- |
| <code class="level200">200</code> | OK. User was edited successfully. |
| <code class="level400">417</code> | Expectation Failed. Something was wrong or missing with the properties supplied for this user. See the `_status_extra` value for more detail. |

<aside class="notice">
The maximum batch size is <i>50</i> users. If exceeded, a <code class="standout">413: Request entity too large</code> HTTP response will be returned.
