### HTTP Request

<img src="images/delete.png" alt="delete"/><api>https://rest.tsheets.com/api/v1/timesheets</api>

### Parameters
_If no filters are specified at all, no timesheets are deleted._

|                |             |             |
| -------------: | :---------: | ----------- |
| **ids**<br/>optional | _Int_ | Comma separated list of timesheet ids you'd like to delete. Note that timesheets are actually _deleted_, not archived. |

### Status Codes
Each timesheet that is deleted will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the timesheet was deleted successfully. If there was a problem deleting a timesheet, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

|         |          |
| :-----: | :------- |
| <code class="level200">200</code> | OK. Timesheet was deleted successfully. |
| <code class="level400">404</code> | Not Found. Timesheet either has never existed or has already been deleted. |
| <code class="level400">409</code> | Conflict. Because a conflict would have resulted in the change requested, the timesheet was not modified. The unmodified timesheet's properties will be included in the response, to make it easy to revert to the unmodified version of the timesheet. |
| <code class="level400">417</code> | Expectation Failed. Something went wrong for this timesheet. See the `_status_extra` value for more detail. |

<aside class="warning">
All attached files of deleted timesheets will be removed <b>permanently</b> unless they are attached to other objects.
