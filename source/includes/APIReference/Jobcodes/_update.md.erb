## Update Jobcodes

<%= partial "includes/APIReference/Jobcodes/Examples/update.tmpl.erb" %>

Edit one or more jobcodes in your company.

### HTTP Request

<img src="../../images/put.png" alt="put"/><api>https://rest.tsheets.com/api/v1/jobcodes</api>

### Properties
_Pass an array of jobcode objects as the value to a 'data' property (see example)._

|                |             |             |
| -------------: | :---------: | ----------- |
| **id**<br/>required | _Int_ | Id of the jobcode. |

Other properties defined on a [jobcode object](#the-jobcode-object) may be passed in to the request with a new value in order to change it. If the value passed in is the same as it was previously, or if a particular property is not passed in at all, it will be ignored.

<aside class="notice">
You cannot edit a jobcode that is <i>archived</i>. You must restore the jobcode first. It is permissible to make an edit to a jobcode and restore it in a single edit request (i.e. change active to <i>1</i> and rename the jobcode in one step).
</aside>

### Status Codes

Each jobcode that is edited will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the jobcode was edited successfully. If there was a problem editing a jobcode, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

|         |          |
| :-----: | :------- |
| <code class="level200">200</code> | OK. Jobcode was edited successfully. |
| <code class="level400">417</code> | Expectation Failed. Something was wrong or missing with the properties supplied for this jobcode. See the `_status_extra` value for more detail. |
 
<aside class="notice">
The maximum batch size is <i>50</i> jobcodes. If exceeded, a <code class="standout">413: Request entity too large</code> HTTP response will be returned.
