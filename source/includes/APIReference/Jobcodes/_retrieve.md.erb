<%= partial "includes/APIReference/Jobcodes/Examples/retrieve.tmpl.erb" %>

Retrieves a list of all jobcodes associated with your company, with optional filters to narrow down the results. For a more efficient way of retrieving jobcodes assigned to a _specific user_, please see the [Jobcode Assignments](#the-jobcode-assignments-object) endpoint.

### Filter Parameters
|                |             |             |
| -------------: | :---------: | ----------- |
| **ids**<br/>optional | _Int_ | Comma separated list of one or more jobcode ids you'd like to filter on. Only jobcodes with an id set to one of these values will be returned. If omitted, all jobcodes matching other specified filters are returned. |
| **parent_ids**<br/>optional | _Int_ | Default is _-1_ (meaning all jobcodes will be returned regardless of `parent_id`).<br/><br/>Comma separated list of one or more jobcode `parent_ids` you'd like to filter on. Only jobcodes with a `parent_id` set to one of these values will be returned. Additionally you can use _0_ to get only the top-level jobcodes. Then get the `id` of any results with `has_children`=_yes_ and feed that in as the value of `parent_ids` for your next request to get the 2nd level of jobcodes, and so on, to traverse an entire tree of jobcodes.<br/><br/>Use _-1_ to return all jobcodes regardless of `parent_id`. This is especially useful when combined with the `modified_since` filter. When `parent_ids` is _-1_, you'll have the jobcode records needed to trace each result back to it's top level parent in the `supplemental_data` section of the response. |
| **type**<br/>optional | _String_ | Indicates jobcode type. One of 'regular', 'pto', 'paid_break', 'unpaid_break', or 'all'.  Default is 'regular'. |
| **active**<br/>optional | _String_ | 'yes', 'no', or 'both'. Default is 'yes'. If a jobcode is active, it is available for selection during time entry. |
| **modified_before**<br/>optional | _String_ | Only jobcodes modified before this date/time will be returned, in ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss±hh:mm`). |
| **modified_since**<br/>optional | _String_ | Only jobcodes modified since this date/time will be returned, in ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss±hh:mm`). |
| **supplemental_data**<br/>optional | _String_ | 'yes' or 'no'. Default is 'yes'. Indicates whether supplemental data should be returned. |
| **per_page**<br/>optional | _Int_ | Represents how many results you'd like to retrieve per request (page). Default is 50. Max is 50. |
| **page**<br/>optional | _Int_ | Represents the page of results you'd like to retrieve. Default is 1. |
