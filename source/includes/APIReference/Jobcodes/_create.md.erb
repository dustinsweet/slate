### Properties
_Pass an array of jobcode objects as the value to a 'data' property (see example)._

|                |             |             |
| -------------: | :---------: | ----------- |
| **name**<br/>required | _String_ | Name of the jobcode. |

For a full list of the properties that may be set on a jobcode, see the [Jobcode object](#the-jobcode-object).

### Status Codes

Each jobcode that is created will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the jobcode was created successfully. If there was a problem creating a jobcode, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

|         |          |
| :-----: | :------- |
| <code class="level200">200</code> | OK. Jobcode was created successfully. |
| <code class="level200">202</code> | 	OK. Jobcode accepted but not created because a jobcode with the same parent_id, name and type already exists. |
| <code class="level400">417</code> | Expectation Failed. Something was wrong or missing with the properties supplied for this jobcode. See the `_status_extra` value for more detail. |

<aside class="notice">
The maximum batch size is <i>50</i> jobcodes. If exceeded, a <code class="standout">413: Request entity too large</code> HTTP response will be returned.
