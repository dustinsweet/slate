### Properties
_Pass an array of jobcode assignment objects as the value to a 'data' property (see example)._

|                |             |             |
| -------------: | :---------: | ----------- |
| **user_id**<br/>required | _Int_ | User id for this jobcode assignment. _(See note below)_|
| **jobcode_id**<br/>required | _Int_ | Jobcode id for this jobcode assignment. |

### Status Codes
Each jobcode assignment that is created will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the jobcode assignment was created successfully. If there was a problem creating a jobcode assignment, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

|         |          |
| :-----: | :------- |
| <code class="level200">200</code> | OK. Jobcode assignment was created successfully. |
| <code class="level400">417</code> | Expectation Failed. Something was wrong or missing with the properties supplied for this jobcode assignment. See the `_status_extra` value for more detail. |

When assigning jobcodes, keep in mind that when assigning a parent jobcode (in a multi-level jobcode scenario), all child jobcodes will also be assigned to the user.
