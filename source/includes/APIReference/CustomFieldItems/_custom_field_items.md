# Custom Field Items

A Custom Field Item represents an allowable value for a Custom Field Object of _managed-list_ type.  Each item represents a single drop-down choice displayed to the user in the web UI.  The API provides methods to Create, Read, and Update custom field items.  Set the `active` property _false_ to archive (i.e. soft delete) a custom field item.
