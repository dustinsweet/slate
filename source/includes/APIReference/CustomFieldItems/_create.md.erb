_Pass an array of customfielditem objects as the value to a 'data' property (see example)._

### Status Codes
Each customfielditem that is created will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the customfielditem was created successfully. If there was a problem creating a customfielditem, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.
