### HTTP Request

<img src="images/put.png" alt="put"/><api>https://rest.tsheets.com/api/v1/{ENTITY_NAME}</api>

### Properties
_Pass an array of {ENTITY_NAME} objects as the value to a 'data' property (see example)._

|                |             |             |
| -------------: | :---------: | ----------- |
| **id**<br/>required | _Int_ | Id of the group. |

{NOTE:REMOVE_IF_NOT_APPLICABLE}
All other properties defined on a [{ENTITY_NAME} object]({ANCHOR_LINK}) may be passed in to the request with a new value in order to change it. If the value passed in is the same as it was previously, or if a particular property is not passed in at all, it will be ignored.

### Status Codes

Each {ENTITY_NAME} that is edited will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the {ENTITY_NAME} was edited successfully. If there was a problem editing a {ENTITY_NAME}, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.
